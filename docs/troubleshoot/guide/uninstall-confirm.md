	Just so we're clear: you should never, ever, **EVER** uninstall custom firmware in an attempt to:

	- Fix an issue you're experiencing
	- Re-install custom firmware with a "cleaner setup"
	- Avoid a ban on the console

	Uninstalling custom firmware is a long process that isn't entirely risk-free unlike most other pages on the guide. If you skip steps, you genuinely do run the risk of bricking your device.

	Instead, you should instead use custom firmware to diagnose the issue you're having. You can ask for help with this at [Nintendo Homebrew on Discord](https://discord.gg/MWxPgEp).

	For a list of detailed reasons why you should not uninstall custom firmware, see [this page](https://ihaveahax.net/view/Why_not_to_remove_custom_firmware).
