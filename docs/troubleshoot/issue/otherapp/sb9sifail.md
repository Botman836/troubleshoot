There is an issue with the file `SafeB9SInstaller.bin`.

Download the latest release of [SafeB9SInstaller](https://github.com/d0k3/SafeB9SInstaller/releases/tag/v0.0.7), extract it,  and place `SafeB9SInstalller.bin` on the root of your SD card. Do not add the `.bin` extension if you do not already see it.
