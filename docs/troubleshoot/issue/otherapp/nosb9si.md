# Failed to open SafeB9SInstaller.bin

The file `SafeB9SInstaller.bin` is missing or misplaced.

Download the latest release of [SafeB9SInstaller](https://github.com/d0k3/SafeB9SInstaller/releases/tag/v0.0.7), extract it,  and place `SafeB9SInstalller.bin` on the root of your SD card. Do not add the `.bin` extension if you do not already see it.

- For reference, the root of the SD card is the directory where you can see the `Nintendo 3DS` folder, but aren't inside of it.
