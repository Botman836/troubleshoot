# Failed to mount the SD card

![Image](/images/otherapp/sdmount.png)

Your SD card was likely formatted with a tool known to cause this issue, such as MiniTool Partition Wizard or the HP formatting tool.

Back up your data and reformat your SD card as FAT32 with the recommended tool depending on your operating system ([Windows](https://3ds.hacks.guide/formatting-sd-(windows)), [macOS](https://3ds.hacks.guide/formatting-sd-(mac)), [Linux](https://3ds.hacks.guide/formatting-sd-(linux))). Then, try again.

If this is unsuccessful, try using another SD card.
