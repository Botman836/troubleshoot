There is an issue with your `otherapp.bin` file. 

Download the latest release of [universal-otherapp](https://github.com/TuxSH/universal-otherapp/releases/latest) and place it on the root of your SD card, replacing the existing one.

If you have a Taiwan/HK or Mainland Chinese device (with a T or C in the version string), you may be encountering an issue with universal-otherapp. Join the Nintendo Homebrew server for assistance.
