You did not copy the `gm9` folder from the GodMode9 `.zip` to the root of your SD card. Download the latest release of [GodMode9](https://github.com/d0k3/GodMode9/releases/latest) and place the `gm9` folder on the root of your SD card, merging it with the existing one.

You may also need to re-mount your SD card in GodMode9 by pressing (Right Shoulder) + (B) if the SDCARD drive (normally at the top) is missing from the drives list. If this is not possible for you, close and re-enter GodMode9 (Home button -> Poweroff system, then hold START on boot to re-enter GodMode9).
