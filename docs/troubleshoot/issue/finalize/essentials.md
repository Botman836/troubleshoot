You most likely said "No" to the "Do you want to create an essential files backup" prompt. Close GodMode9 (Home button -> Poweroff system), then re-open it (hold START while turning on your 3DS) and the prompt should reappear. Select yes and the `essentials.exefs` option will appear in SYSNAND VIRTUAL.
