Your friend code was blocked from using the friend code bot because your 3DS did not successfully friend the bot (*you* must add the bot as a friend - the bot will not send you a request). Ensure your 3DS is properly connected to the Internet, then join the Nintendo Homebrew server and ask to be unlocked.
