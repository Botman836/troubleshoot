There's actually no issue here! The website has already mined your `movable.sed` using your friend code and ID0 combination. You can use the `movable.sed` that it provides you, even if the bot didn't add you back.

The `movable.sed` is for sure correct for your friend code and ID0 and combination - it is technically impossible for the website to proceed without having received the information from the friend exchange at some point.
