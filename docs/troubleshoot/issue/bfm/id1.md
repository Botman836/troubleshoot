# Looks like an ID1

Just so we're clear: The ID1 is the long folder name inside of the first long folder name in the Nintendo 3DS Folder. You want the first long folder name - NOT the second one.

If you are for sure picking the first long folder name, then it's possible that BruteforceMovable mis-identified your ID0 as an ID1. There is no bypass for this, so you'll need to ask a human for help.
