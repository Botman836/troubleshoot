# Missing "usm.bin"

You are missing `usm.bin` from the root of the SD card. You can go get it from [here](https://github.com/zoogie/unSAFE_MODE/releases/download/v1.3/usm.bin) (direct download).
	- For reference, the root of the SD card is the directory where you can see the `Nintendo 3DS` folder, but aren't inside of it.
