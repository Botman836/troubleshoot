If your device is on system version 9.4.0, 9.5.0, or 9.6.0, you may be encountering a bug with an older version of universal-otherapp. If this is the case, download the latest release of [universal-otherapp](https://github.com/TuxSH/universal-otherapp/releases/latest) and place it on the root of your SD card, replacing the existing one.

If your device is not on those firmwares, it likely indicates that you already have custom firmware. You should check for CFW.
