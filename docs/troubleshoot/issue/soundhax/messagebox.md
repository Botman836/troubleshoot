There is an issue with your `otherapp.bin` file.

Download the latest release of [universal-otherapp](https://github.com/TuxSH/universal-otherapp/releases/latest) and place it on the root of your SD card.

- For reference, the root of the SD card is the directory where you can see the `Nintendo 3DS` folder, but aren't inside of it.
