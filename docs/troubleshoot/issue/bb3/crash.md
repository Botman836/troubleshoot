Ensure that `F00D43D5.bin` is the only file in `Nintendo 3DS` -> `<ID0>` -> `<ID1>` -> `Nintendo DSiWare`. If it is, then re-create it with the relevant tool depending on the guide you're following:

[unSAFE_MODE](https://3ds.nhnarwhal.com/3dstools/unsafemode.php){ .md-button } [BannerBomb3 Tool](https://3ds.nhnarwhal.com/3dstools/bannerbomb3.php){ .md-button }

If this console has had custom firmware before, it is likely that custom firmware was removed in a way that makes this method impossible to perform. Try the PicHaxx method, and/or join the Nintendo Homebrew server for assistance.
