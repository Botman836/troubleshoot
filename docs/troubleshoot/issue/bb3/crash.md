# DSiWare Management menu crashes

Ensure that `bb3.bin` is on the root of the SD card (if you need it, it's in the `DSIWARE_EXPLOIT.zip` file that you got `F00D43D5.bin` from):

Also, ensure that `F00D43D5.bin` is the only file in `Nintendo 3DS` -> `<ID0>` -> `<ID1>` -> `Nintendo DSiWare`.

If this console has had custom firmware before, it is likely that custom firmware was removed in a way that makes Seedminer-based methods impossible to perform.

If you have a copy (digital or physical) of Mario Kart 7 *and* a second, modded 3DS, you can try the [kartdlphax](https://3ds.hacks.guide/installing-boot9strap-(kartdlphax)) method.

If you have a compatible DS flashcart, you can try the [ntrboot](https://3ds.hacks.guide/ntrboot) method.
