There may be an issue with your `F00D43D5.bin` file (it may be corrupted or you used the `movable.sed` for a different 3DS when creating it). Re-create your F00D43D5.bin file with the [Bannerbomb3 Injector](https://3dstools.nhnarwhal.com/#/bb3gen), ensuring that you use the movable.sed file for your console.
