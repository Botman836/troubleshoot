# SigHaxed FIRM - File not found

You are missing `boot9strap.firm` and `boot9strap.firm.sha` from the `boot9strap` folder, or the `boot9strap` folder is misnamed.

Download the latest release of [boot9strap](https://github.com/SciresM/boot9strap/releases/download/1.4/boot9strap-1.4.zip), and place `boot9strap.firm` and `boot9strap.firm.sha` in the `boot9strap` folder.

- Note that `boot9strap-1.4`, `bootstrap9`, and other derivatives are *not* going to be detected as correct. The folder **MUST** be named exactly `boot9strap`.
