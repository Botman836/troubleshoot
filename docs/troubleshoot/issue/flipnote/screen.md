There is an issue with the file `boot.nds`.

Download the latest release of [b9stool](https://github.com/zoogie/b9sTool/releases/latest) and place `boot.nds` on the root of your SD card.

- For reference, the root of the SD card is the directory where you can see the `Nintendo 3DS` folder, but aren't inside of it.
