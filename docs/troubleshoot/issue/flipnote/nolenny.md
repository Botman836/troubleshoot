You didn't copy the `private` folder from the Frogminer_save `.zip` to the root of your SD card.
	
You can get it from [here](https://github.com/zoogie/Frogminer/releases/download/v1.0/Frogminer_save.zip).

- For reference, the root of the SD card is the directory where you can see the `Nintendo 3DS` folder, but aren't inside of it.
