# No Nintendo 3DS folder

If you don't have a `Nintendo 3DS` folder, your SD card probably isn't being read by your 3DS due to a formatting or contact issue. Keep in mind that the 3DS can only read SD cards formatted as FAT32/MBR (that is, exFAT/NTFS or GPT will not work).

You can reformat your SD card with one of these guides ([Windows](https://3ds.hacks.guide/formatting-sd-(windows)), [macOS](https://3ds.hacks.guide/formatting-sd-(mac)), [Linux](https://3ds.hacks.guide/formatting-sd-(linux))).
