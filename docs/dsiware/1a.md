This means that you haven't put your SD card into your 3DS yet. Put your SD card into your 3DS, then turn it on. You should see a message box like this one:

[I get a message about write protection](/dsiware/writelock){ .md-button }

Once it's done, turn off your 3DS and put your SD card back into your computer. The `Nintendo 3DS` folder should now be generated.

[It generated](/dsiware/2){ .md-button }

[It's still missing](/dsiware/1c){ .md-button }
