You need to put bb3.bin in this location. To do so:

Get your DSIWARE_EXPLOIT.zip file. If you don't have it, get it from [here](http://3dstools.nhnarwhal.com/#/bb3gen) using your `movable.sed` file that you got from [Bruteforce Movable](https://seedminer.hacks.guide). Then, click (or double-click) on it to open it. You should see something like this:

Then, you can drag-and-drop it to the SD Card window:

[Got it, next step](/dsiware/2){ .md-button }

[It won't let me copy the file](/dsiware/writelock){ .md-button }
