# Step 1c: Unformatted SD card

Chances are, your SD card is not formatted in a way that the 3DS can read it.

Follow the instructions [here](https://wiki.hacks.guide/wiki/Formatting_an_SD_card) to format the card. (This will delete all data on the card, so make a backup if you have anything you care about). Once done, go back to the previous step on this page.
