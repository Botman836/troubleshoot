# Step 4a: Already have DSiWare

First of all, make sure that the folder is spelled correctly. The folder should be named EXACTLY `Nintendo DSiWare`. Any derivatives of this (such as `Ninendo DSiWare`, `Nintendo DSi Ware` or `DSiWare` will NOT work.)

If you're using macOS or Linux, it is also possible to accidentally add a space to the beginning or end of the folder name, like so:

![Image](/images/dsiware/spacebeg.png) ![Image](/images/dsiware/spaceend.png)

If it's named correctly, open the folder. What do you see?

[Nothing](/dsiware/6){ .md-button }

[F00D43D5.bin](/dsiware/done){ .md-button }

[42383841.bin](/dsiware/6a){ .md-button }

[![Image](/images/dsiware/multidsi.png){ align=left }Multiple files](/dsiware/6b){ .md-button }
