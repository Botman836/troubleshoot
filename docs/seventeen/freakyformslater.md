A new otherapp has been made available for this method, but it hasn't been independently tested yet. If this works for you, let me know on Discord (I'm `lily â™ª#0208` - copy-paste it)!

To use these otherapps, follow the instructions on the "Go to" link, but download one of these files instead of using the one from `otherapp_with_cfgS` and rename it accordingly.
