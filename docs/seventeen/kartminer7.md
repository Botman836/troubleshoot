YES! You can (probably) install custom firmware using Kartminer7.

**Notes**:

+ This method involves modifying SD card data used for Mario Kart 7, which includes anything within the Mario Kart Channel (e.g. StreetPass races). While this data is backed up and restored, it is still possible that this data will be lost as restoration of this data has not been completely confirmed.
+ This method is still relatively new and may not work properly. If it fails, there is no risk to your console or its data (beyond Mario Kart Channel data).
+ The instructions provided on the guide currently only work on **Windows**, but this exploit can also be installed using computers running **macOS** or **Linux** (any distro). (You may need some command-line knowledge to do so.) Phones and tablets are most likely incompatible. (Maybe try [Termux](https://github.com/termux/termux-app#github)?)
