YES! You can install CFW through smilehax-IIe.

If you have a USA 3DS, you must use these otherapps instead of the ones provided on the website. To use these otherapps, follow the instructions on the "Go to" link, but download one of these files instead of using the one from `otherapp_with_cfgS` and rename it accordingly.
