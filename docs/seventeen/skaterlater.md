The otherapp for super-skaterhax needs to be updated to support USA 11.17.0. So, you WILL be able to use super-skaterhax to install CFW on your 3DS, but *not yet*. Check back for updates!

(The recently released otherapp for USA 11.17 does not yet support super-skaterhax due to an additional dependency.)

You can also check to see if another alternate method will work for you, depending on the applications you have installed or the physical hardware that you have access to:
