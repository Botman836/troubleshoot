YES (most likely)! You can install CFW through MSET9.

**Notes**:

+ This method currently only supports traditional desktop/laptop computers (Windows/macOS/Linux). Phones and tablets are not currently supported. If you don't have access to a computer, you'll need to try one of the old software/hardware-reliant [alternate methods](/seventeen/hardware).
