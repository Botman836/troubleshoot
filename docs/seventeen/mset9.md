YES (most likely)! You can install CFW through MSET9.

**Notes**:

+ This method is currently **very new**, so it may be difficult to get help if something goes awry. It might be worth using an older method if you have access to [Pok√©mon Picross](/seventeen/pichaxx), [Steel Diver: Sub Wars](/seventeen/steelhax), [Mario Kart 7](/seventeen/kartminer7), [Cubic Ninja](/seventeen/ninjhax), [Freakyforms Deluxe](/seventeen/freakyhax), [a DS flashcart](/seventeen/ntrboot), OR [another 3DS with CFW](/seventeen/kartdlphax).
+ This method involves modifying data in your Nintendo 3DS folder. If something goes wrong and you delete the wrong folder inside of the Nintendo 3DS folder, you may lose game or save data, so **it is a good idea to make a backup of your SD card data** in case something goes wrong.
+ This method currently only supports computers running **Windows** and **Linux** (any distro). Phones, tablets, and macOS are not currently supported. If you don't have access to a computer running Windows or Linux, you'll need to try one of the old software/hardware-reliant [alternate methods](/seventeen/hardware).
