# Result: NOT YET

The otherapp for ninjhax2-dx needs to be updated to support USA 11.17.0. So, you WILL be able to use ninjhax2-dx to install CFW on your 3DS, but *not yet*. Check back for updates!

(The recently released otherapp for USA 11.17 does not yet support ninjhax due to an additional dependency.)

(NOTE: You need a working 3DS camera!)
