The otherapp for kartdlphax needs to be updated to support USA 11.17.0. So, you WILL be able to use kartdlphax to install CFW on your 3DS, but *not yet*. Check back for updates!

(You will need to obtain a digital or cartridge copy of Mario Kart 7. The 3DS with CFW must also be (or be changed to) the region of the 3DS you are trying to mod.)
