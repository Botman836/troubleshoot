Unfortunately, you currently can't install CFW on your console without external hardware :(

If you are unwilling to wait for a new exploit to be discovered (no estimated timeframe), the cheapest available method is ntrboot, which will require buying a compatible DS flashcart (roughly $8 USD). You can buy a preflashed cartridge from [here](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005005337644588.html) (AliExpress, volatile link/listing, not always kept updated) or [here](https://www.nds-card.com/ProShow.asp?ProID=575) (nds-card, static link, but more expensive)

If you are comfortable with [soldering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soldering), you can also try [hardmodding your console](https://3ds.hacks.guide/installing-boot9strap-(hardmod)).
